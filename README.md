This the first project I completed for the Software Development Mastermind program.

Additionally, it is the first project that I have completed from beginning to end and my first repository on Github.

I really learned a lot about creating functions and passing parameters into them.

Wow, what a time to be alive!! I wrote my first CSS @media query to make the app responsive by screen width! It is really cool.
